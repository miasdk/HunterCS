## üìÖ **Daily Plan A: Fall 2025 Sprint (2-6 weeks)**
*For immediate applications due July-August 2025*

### **Week 1: Learn 1 Pattern, Practice 1 Pattern**
**Goal**: Master hash table pattern completely

#### **Day 1-2: Hash Tables**
**Morning (30 minutes)**:
1. Read: `335/STL/std::unordered_map.md` - just the "Core Interview Patterns" section
2. Study the Two Sum example - understand every line

**Afternoon (30 minutes)**:
1. Code Two Sum from memory (no looking!)
2. If stuck, check the example, then try again
3. **Goal**: Write it perfectly 3 times in a row

#### **Day 3-4: Hash Variations**
**Daily (30 minutes)**:
1. Try Contains Duplicate problem
2. Use the same hash table pattern from Two Sum
3. Check your solution against `335/Exam02/code/contains_duplicate_ii.cpp`

#### **Day 5-7: Tree Basics**
**Daily (30 minutes)**:
1. Read: `335/Reference/Trees.md` - just the "Tree Traversal" section
2. Practice: Write tree traversal from memory
3. **Don't worry about advanced tree operations yet**

### **Week 2: Mock Interviews**
**Daily (45 minutes)**:
1. Pick one problem from `335/Final/practice/`
2. Time yourself: 30 minutes to solve
3. Use your bookmarked cheat sheets when stuck
4. **Focus on explaining your thought process out loud**

---

## üìÖ **Daily Plan B: Summer 2026 Preparation (6+ weeks)**
*For applications opening August-November 2025*

### **Week 1: Foundation (30 minutes/day)**
- **Monday**: Hash tables - Two Sum pattern
- **Tuesday**: Practice Two Sum variations
- **Wednesday**: Tree traversals basics
- **Thursday**: Practice tree problems
- **Friday**: Review week's patterns

### **Week 2: Pattern Integration (45 minutes/day)**
- Combine hash tables + trees in problems
- Use `335/Reference/` guides for deeper understanding
- Practice explaining solutions clearly

### **Week 3+: Advanced Topics**
- Follow the comprehensive plan in `HunterCS-Adaptive-Interview-Prep-Plan.md`
- Use `335/Reference/DP.md` for dynamic programming
- Practice with `335/Final/practice/` problems

## ‚ùì **About LeetCode**

### **TL;DR: You don't need LeetCode right now**

**Why your repository is better than LeetCode for learning:**
1. **Your guides explain WHY** algorithms work - LeetCode just gives you problems
2. **Your code examples are documented** - you understand every line
3. **Your materials are organized** - LeetCode is random problem chaos
4. **You build confidence** with familiar materials first

### **When to use LeetCode (optional)**
**After mastering 3-4 patterns with your repository:**
- Use LeetCode for **additional practice** of patterns you already know
- **Filter by pattern** (e.g., only hash table problems)
- **Use your guides** as reference when stuck on LeetCode problems

### **LeetCode Integration Strategy**
```
Week 1-2: Use ONLY your repository (build confidence)
Week 3+: Add 1-2 LeetCode problems per pattern (if desired)
Always: Use your guides as primary reference material
```

## üö® **Anti-Overwhelm Rules**

### **Rule 1: One Pattern at a Time**
- Master hash tables completely before moving to trees
- Don't jump around between topics

### **Rule 2: Use the Same Files**
- Stick to your bookmarked files for first 2 weeks
- Don't explore new files until current ones are mastered

### **Rule 3: Quality Over Quantity**
- Better to understand 3 problems deeply than rush through 10
- Rewrite the same problem until it's automatic

### **Rule 4: Progress Not Perfection**
- Can't solve a problem? That's normal and expected
- Look at the solution, understand it, try again tomorrow

### **Rule 5: Ask for Help**
- Stuck on a concept? Ask specific questions
- "I don't understand line 15 in two_sum.cpp" is much better than "I don't get hash tables"

---

## üìû **When You're Stuck**

### **Problem: "I don't understand hash tables"**
**Solution**: 
1. Read ONLY the "Pattern 1" section in `335/STL/std::unordered_map.md`
2. Copy the Two Sum code by hand (don't type, physically write it)
3. Run through the example with specific numbers

### **Problem: "I can't solve any problems"**
**Solution**:
1. You're trying problems that are too hard
2. Go back to `335/Exam02/code/two_sum.cpp`
3. Master this ONE problem completely first

### **Problem: "There's too much material"**
**Solution**:
1. Close all files except this user manual
2. Follow ONLY the daily plan above
3. Ignore everything else for now

### **Problem: "I feel behind compared to others"**
**Solution**:
1. Your repository is better than most people's resources
2. Quality of study matters more than quantity
3. Focus on your own progress, not others'

## üéØ **Remember**

**You don't need to learn everything at once.** This repository has enough material for months of study. The goal is to start small, build confidence, and gradually expand your skills.

**Start with 20 minutes today. Master one pattern. Build from there.**
