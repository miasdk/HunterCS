# 🚀 START HERE - Your C++ Interview Success Path

## 📖 Read This First
**Feeling overwhelmed?** You're in the right place. This repository contains EVERYTHING you need for **C++ technical interviews**, but you don't need to read everything.

> **🔧 LANGUAGE FOCUS:** This repository is optimized for **C++ interviews** using modern C++ (C++17/20) and STL mastery.

### Quick Start (Choose One):
1. **📚 Read the User Manual**: `335-User-Manual-START-HERE.md` ← **Start here if new**
2. **⚡ Jump to Practice**: Go to `../Quick-Reference/` for C++ STL materials
3. **🎯 Take Baseline Test**: Try `../Code-Library/By-Topic/Hashing/two_sum.cpp` from memory

## 🗂️ Repository Navigation Made Simple

### 📁 **USE DAILY** (Your main folders):
```
├── 📍 START-HERE/           ← You are here
├── ⚡ Quick-Reference/       ← C++ STL cheat sheets & patterns
├── 🎯 Interview-Prep/       ← Pattern-based C++ practice
└── 💻 Code-Library/         ← Modern C++ examples
```

### 📚 **USE AS NEEDED** (Reference materials):
```
├── 📖 Reference/            ← Comprehensive C++ theory
└── 🎓 Course-Materials/     ← Academic content
```

### 🔧 **IGNORE FOR NOW**:
```
├── Tools/                   ← C++ utilities (advanced)
```

## 🎯 Your C++ Success Metrics
- **Week 1 Goal**: Master `std::unordered_map/set` patterns completely
- **Week 2 Goal**: Add tree traversal with modern C++ confidence  
- **Week 3+**: Build C++ template library systematically

## 🔧 Why C++ for Interviews?
- **Performance critical** roles (systems, gaming, HFT)
- **Memory management** understanding shows depth
- **STL proficiency** demonstrates advanced knowledge
- **Popular at top tech companies** (Google, Meta, Microsoft)

## 🆘 Stuck? Follow This Order:
1. Read User Manual (`335-User-Manual-START-HERE.md`)
2. Check Quick-Reference for C++ STL materials
3. Practice ONE pattern at a time in Interview-Prep
4. Use Code-Library for modern C++ examples
5. Reference theory docs only when needed

## 🐍 Python Developer?
Planning a **Python version** of this systematic approach? Check out `../PYTHON-REPO-TEMPLATE.md` for creating `HunterCS-Interview-Prep-Python` with the same anti-overwhelm structure but optimized for Python's strengths!
