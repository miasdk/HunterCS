# Daily Practice - Interview Success System

## 🎯 Philosophy: Quality Over Quantity
**20-30 minutes daily beats 4-hour weekend cramming**

Daily consistent practice builds:
- **Pattern recognition** (most important skill)
- **Coding confidence** under pressure
- **Muscle memory** for common templates
- **Mental resilience** for interview stress

## 📅 Daily Practice Structure

### Option A: Pattern Mastery (Recommended)
```
┌─ Day 1-7: Hash Table Pattern
├─ Day 8-14: Tree Traversal Pattern  
├─ Day 15-21: Array/Two-Pointer Pattern
├─ Day 22-28: Dynamic Programming Pattern
└─ Day 29+: Graph Algorithm Pattern
```

### Option B: Mixed Practice
```
┌─ Monday: Hash Table + Review
├─ Tuesday: Trees + Previous mistakes
├─ Wednesday: Arrays + Mock interview
├─ Thursday: DP + Template practice
├─ Friday: Graphs + Company prep
├─ Saturday: Mock interview session
└─ Sunday: Review week + plan next
```

## ⏱️ Daily Session Format (25 minutes)

### Warm-up (5 minutes)
- Review yesterday's problem without looking at solution
- Check one template from `Code-Library/Templates/`
- Quick pattern recognition quiz

### Core Practice (15 minutes)
- **NEW learners**: Solve 1 problem with hints/solutions
- **REVIEWING**: Solve 1 problem from memory 
- **ADVANCED**: Solve 1 new + 1 review problem

### Wrap-up (5 minutes)  
- Update practice log
- Note patterns used
- Identify tomorrow's focus

## 📊 Practice Tracking

### Week 1 Example: Hash Table Mastery
```
Day 1: ✅ Two Sum (Easy) - 12 min - Hash pattern ⭐⭐⭐
Day 2: ✅ Valid Anagram (Easy) - 8 min - Frequency counting ⭐⭐
Day 3: ✅ Contains Duplicate (Easy) - 5 min - Set lookup ⭐
Day 4: ✅ Two Sum (Easy) - 4 min - FROM MEMORY ⭐⭐⭐
Day 5: ✅ Contains Duplicate II (Med) - 15 min - Index tracking ⭐⭐
Day 6: ✅ Group Anagrams (Med) - 18 min - Grouping pattern ⭐⭐
Day 7: 📝 REVIEW: Solve all 5 problems under 30 min total
```

### Progress Indicators
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Critical** - Must solve from memory
- ⭐⭐ **Important** - Should solve confidently  
- ⭐ **Good to know** - Solve with some help

## 🔄 The Anti-Overwhelm Method

### Rule 1: One Pattern at a Time
- Week 1: ONLY hash tables
- Week 2: ONLY trees
- Week 3: ONLY arrays
- **Never** jump between patterns randomly

### Rule 2: Master Before Moving
- Can solve 3-5 core problems from memory?
- Understand the underlying pattern?
- Can explain solution to someone else?
- **Only then** → move to next pattern

### Rule 3: Daily Consistency Beats Weekend Heroics
- 25 minutes daily = 175 minutes/week
- Better than 3-hour weekend session
- Builds interview stamina and confidence

## 📈 Weekly Milestones

- [ ] Explain frequency counting pattern
- [ ] Identify hash table problems instantly
- [ ] Complete 5+ hash problems

### Week 2: Tree Traversal Fluency  
- [ ] Write DFS/BFS templates from memory
- [ ] Solve tree depth problems instantly
- [ ] Understand recursive thinking
- [ ] Complete 5+ tree problems

### Week 3: Array Manipulation Skills
- [ ] Use two-pointer technique confidently

- [ ] Solve under time pressure
- [ ] Mock interview performance
- [ ] Company-specific practice

## 🎯 Problem Selection Strategy

### Phase 1: Pattern Building (Weeks 1-3)
Focus on **pattern-pure** problems:
- Two Sum, Valid Anagram, Contains Duplicate
- Maximum Depth, Same Tree, Level Order
- Remove Duplicates, Valid Palindrome, Container Water

### Phase 2: Pattern Mixing (Weeks 4-6)
Combine patterns:
- Tree + Hash: Path Sum with counting
- Array + DP: Maximum subarray problems
- Graph + Hash: Course scheduling

### Phase 3: Company Prep (Weeks 7+)
Focus on **company-specific** patterns:
- Google: Graph algorithms, system design
- Amazon: Leadership principles coding
- Microsoft: Trees, dynamic programming
- Meta: Product thinking + algorithms

### Quick Pattern Check
Before solving ANY problem, ask:
1. "What pattern does this look like?"
2. "Have I seen this before?"
3. "What's the O(n²) brute force?"
4. "How can I optimize it?"

### Red Flags (Stop and Review)
- Taking >20 minutes on "Easy" problems
- Can't recognize patterns immediately  
- Forgetting previously solved problems
- Feeling overwhelmed or frustrated
