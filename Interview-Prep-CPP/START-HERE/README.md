## 🔰 Beginner Path

### Prerequisites
```cpp
// Can you read and understand this?
std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
for (int num : nums) {
    freq[num]++;
}
```
If no → **Start with C++ basics first**
If yes → **You're ready!**

## 🤔 Common Questions

### "Should I learn all STL containers?"
**Answer:** Master the big 5 first: `unordered_map`, `vector`, `queue`, `stack`, `priority_queue`. These solve 80% of interview problems.

### "How many problems should I solve?"
**Answer:** Quality > Quantity. 50 well-understood problems beats 200 rushed solutions.

### "What if I get stuck?"
**Answer:** 15-minute rule. After 15 minutes, look at hint. After 30 minutes, study solution.

### "Should I time myself?"
**Answer:** Not initially. Focus on correctness first, speed comes naturally.
