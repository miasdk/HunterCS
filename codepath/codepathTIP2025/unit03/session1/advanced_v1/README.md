## Problems 1-6

### Problem 1: Create Sequence from Pattern

Given a string `arrival_pattern` of length n consisting of 'I' (increasing) and 'D' (decreasing), create a string of length n+1 using digits '1' to '9' where:
- If `pattern[i] == 'I'`, then `result[i] < result[i + 1]`
- If `pattern[i] == 'D'`, then `result[i] > result[i + 1]`

Return the lexicographically smallest possible result.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def arrange_guest_arrival_order(arrival_pattern):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(arrange_guest_arrival_order("IIIDIDDD"))    # "123549876"
print(arrange_guest_arrival_order("DDD"))         # "4321"
```

### Problem 2: Deck Reveal Simulation

Given an array `attendees`, arrange them so that when revealed using this process, they appear in increasing order:
1. Reveal the top number and remove it
2. If numbers remain, move the next top number to the bottom
3. Repeat until all are revealed

Return the arrangement that reveals numbers in increasing order.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def reveal_attendee_list_in_order(attendees):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(reveal_attendee_list_in_order([17,13,11,2,3,5,7]))    # [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
print(reveal_attendee_list_in_order([1,1000]))              # [1,1000]
```

### Problem 3: Three-Way Partition

Given an array `attendees` and integer `priority`, rearrange the array so that:
- All elements less than `priority` appear first
- All elements equal to `priority` appear in the middle  
- All elements greater than `priority` appear last
- Relative order within each group is preserved

**Function Signature:**
```python
def arrange_attendees_by_priority(attendees, priority):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(arrange_attendees_by_priority([9,12,5,10,14,3,10], 10))    # [9,5,3,10,10,12,14]
print(arrange_attendees_by_priority([-3,4,3,2], 2))             # [-3,2,4,3]
```

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** Two Pointer Variation  
Use three pointers to maintain sections for: less than, equal to, and greater than the target value.

---

### Problem 4: Rearrange by Sign

Given an array `guests` of even length with equal numbers of positive and negative integers, rearrange it so that:
- Every consecutive pair has opposite signs
- Relative order of positive/negative numbers is preserved
- Result starts with a positive number

**Function Signature:**
```python
def rearrange_guests(guests):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(rearrange_guests([3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]))    # [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
print(rearrange_guests([-1,1]))              # [1,-1]
```

---

### Problem 5: Minimum Additions for Valid Parentheses

Given a string `schedule` containing only `(` and `)`, return the minimum number of parentheses you need to add to make the string valid.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def min_changes_to_make_balanced(schedule):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(min_changes_to_make_balanced("())"))    # 1
print(min_changes_to_make_balanced("((("))    # 3
```

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** Choosing the Right Approach  
A stack is good here because we're checking for balance of pairs of symbols.

### Problem 6: String Transformation with Limited Moves

Given strings `event` and `timeline`, start with a string of `?` characters of length `timeline.length`. In each turn, you can place `event` at any valid position to replace `?` characters. 

Return an array of starting indices for each placement to transform the string into `timeline` within `10 * timeline.length` turns. Return empty array if impossible.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def mark_event_timeline(event, timeline):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(mark_event_timeline("abc", "ababc"))      # [0, 2]
print(mark_event_timeline("abca", "aabcaca"))   # [3, 0, 1]
```

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** Pseudocode  
Use BFS with queue. Each state contains current string and list of placement indices. Try all valid placements and enqueue new states.

### Problem 7: Circular Elimination Game

Given a string `votes` with 'C' and 'D' characters, simulate a game where:
- In each round, a player can either ban an opponent or declare victory
- A player declares victory if all remaining players are from their team
- Each player acts optimally

Return "Cat Lovers" or "Dog Lovers" based on who wins.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def predictAdoption_victory(votes):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(predictAdoption_victory("CD"))     # "Cat Lovers"
print(predictAdoption_victory("CDD"))    # "Dog Lovers"
```

### Problem 8: Minimize Maximum Pair Sum

Given an array `discomfort_levels` of even length, pair up elements to minimize the maximum sum among all pairs.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def pair_up_animals(discomfort_levels):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(pair_up_animals([3,5,2,3]))        # 7
print(pair_up_animals([3,5,4,2,4,6]))    # 8
```

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** Two Pointer Technique

---

### Problem 9: Reverse Substrings in Brackets

Given a string `s` with lowercase letters and brackets, reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost ones. Return the result without brackets.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def rearrange_animal_names(s):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(rearrange_animal_names("(dribtacgod)"))       # "dogcatbird"
print(rearrange_animal_names("(!(love(stac))I)"))   # "Ilovecats!"
print(rearrange_animal_names("adopt(yadot(a(tep)))!"))  # "adoptapettoday!"
```

**âœ¨ AI Hint:** Stacks

### Problem 10: Make String Subsequence

Given strings `available` and `preferred`, return the minimum number of characters to append to `available` so that `preferred` becomes a subsequence of `available`.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def append_animals(available, preferred):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(append_animals("catsdogs", "cows"))    # 2
print(append_animals("rabbit", "r"))         # 0
print(append_animals("fish", "bird"))        # 4
```

**ðŸ’¡ Hint:** Choosing the Right Approach

### Problem 11: Partition Labels

Given a string `habitats`, partition it into as many contiguous parts as possible such that each character appears in at most one part. Return a list of the sizes of these parts.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def group_animals_by_habitat(habitats):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(group_animals_by_habitat("ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"))    # [9,7,8]
print(group_animals_by_habitat("eccbbbbdec"))                  # [10]
```

### Problem 12: Validate Stack Sequences

Given two arrays `admitted` and `adopted` with distinct values, return `True` if `adopted` could be the result of a series of push and pop operations on `admitted` using a stack.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def validate_shelter_sequence(admitted, adopted):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
print(validate_shelter_sequence([1,2,3,4,5], [4,5,3,2,1]))    # True
print(validate_shelter_sequence([1,2,3,4,5], [4,3,5,1,2]))    # False
```
