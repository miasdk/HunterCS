### Problem 1: Festival Lineup

Given two lists of strings `artists` and `set_times` of length n, write a function `lineup()` that maps each artist to their set time.

An artist `artists[i]` has set time `set_times[i]`. Assume `0 <= i < n` and `len(artists) == len(set_times)`.

```python
def lineup(artists, set_times):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
artists1 = ["Kendrick Lamar", "Chappell Roan", "Mitski", "Rosalia"]
set_times1 = ["9:30 PM", "5:00 PM", "2:00 PM", "7:30 PM"]

artists2 = []
set_times2 = []

print(lineup(artists1, set_times1))
print(lineup(artists2, set_times2))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
{"Kendrick Lamar": "9:30 PM", "Chappell Roan": "5:00 PM", "Mitski": "2:00 PM", "RosalÃ­a": "7:30 PM"}
{}
```

**âœ¨ AI Hint:** Dictionaries

---

### Problem 2: Planning App

You are designing an app for your festival to help attendees have the best experience possible! As part of the application, users will be able to easily search their favorite artist and find out the day, time, and stage the artist is playing at. Write a function `get_artist_info()` that accepts a string `artist` and a dictionary `festival_schedule` mapping artist's names to dictionaries containing the day, time, and stage they are playing on. Return the dictionary containing the information about the given artist.

If the artist searched for does not exist in `festival_schedule`, return the dictionary `{"message": "Artist not found"}`.

```python
def get_artist_info(artist, festival_schedule):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
festival_schedule = {
    "Blood Orange": {"day": "Friday", "time": "9:00 PM", "stage": "Main Stage"},
    "Metallica": {"day": "Saturday", "time": "8:00 PM", "stage": "Main Stage"},
    "Kali Uchis": {"day": "Sunday", "time": "7:00 PM", "stage": "Second Stage"},
    "Lawrence": {"day": "Friday", "time": "6:00 PM", "stage": "Main Stage"}
}

print(get_artist_info("Blood Orange", festival_schedule)) 
print(get_artist_info("Taylor Swift", festival_schedule))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
{'day': 'Friday', 'time': '9:00 PM', 'stage': 'Main Stage'}
{'message': 'Artist not found'}
```

### Problem 3: Ticket Sales

A dictionary `ticket_sales` is used to map ticket type to number of tickets sold. Return the total number of tickets of all types sold.

```python
def total_sales(ticket_sales):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
ticket_sales = {"Friday": 200, "Saturday": 1000, "Sunday": 800, "3-Day Pass": 2500}

print(total_sales(ticket_sales))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
4500
```

### Problem 4: Scheduling Conflict

Demand for your festival has exceeded expectations, so you're expanding the festival to span two different venues. Some artists will perform both venues, while others will perform at just one. To ensure that there are no scheduling conflicts, implement a function `identify_conflicts()` that accepts two dictionaries `venue1_schedule` and `venue2_schedule` each mapping the artists playing at the venue to their set times. Return a dictionary containing the key-value pairs that are the same in each schedule.

```python
def identify_conflicts(venue1_schedule, venue2_schedule):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
venue1_schedule = {
    "Stromae": "9:00 PM",
    "Janelle MonÃ¡e": "8:00 PM",
    "HARDY": "7:00 PM",
    "Bruce Springsteen": "6:00 PM"
}

venue2_schedule = {
    "Stromae": "9:00 PM",
    "Janelle MonÃ¡e": "10:30 PM",
    "HARDY": "7:00 PM",
    "Wizkid": "6:00 PM"
}

print(identify_conflicts(venue1_schedule, venue2_schedule))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
{"Stromae": "9:00 PM", "HARDY": "7:00 PM"}
```

---

### Problem 5: Best Set

As part of the festival, attendees cast votes for their favorite set. Given a dictionary `votes` that maps attendees id numbers to the artist they voted for, return the artist that had the most number of votes. If there is a tie, return any artist with the top number of votes.

```python
def best_set(votes):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
votes1 = {
    1234: "SZA", 
    1235: "Yo-Yo Ma",
    1236: "Ethel Cain",
    1237: "Ethel Cain",
    1238: "SZA",
    1239: "SZA"
}

votes2 = {
    1234: "SZA", 
    1235: "Yo-Yo Ma",
    1236: "Ethel Cain",
    1237: "Ethel Cain",
    1238: "SZA"
}

print(best_set(votes1))
print(best_set(votes2))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
SZA
Ethel Cain
```

**Note:** SZA and Ethel Cain would both be acceptable answers for the second example

### Problem 6: Performances with Maximum Audience

You are given an array `audiences` consisting of positive integers representing the audience size for different performances at a music festival.

Return the combined audience size of all performances in `audiences` with the maximum audience size.

The audience size of a performance is the number of people who attended that performance.

```python
def max_audience_performances(audiences):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
audiences1 = [100, 200, 200, 150, 100, 250]
audiences2 = [120, 180, 220, 150, 220]

print(max_audience_performances(audiences1))
print(max_audience_performances(audiences2))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
250
440
```

---

### Problem 7: Performances with Maximum Audience II

If you used a dictionary as part of your solution to `max_audience_performances()` in the previous problem, try reimplementing the function without using a dictionary. If you implemented `max_audience_performances()` without using a dictionary, try solving the problem with a dictionary.

Once you've come up with your second solution, compare the two. Is one solution better than the other? Why or why not?

```python
def max_audience_performances(audiences):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
audiences1 = [100, 200, 200, 150, 100, 250]
audiences2 = [120, 180, 220, 150, 220]

print(max_audience_performances(audiences1))
print(max_audience_performances(audiences2))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
250
440
```

### Problem 8: Popular Song Pairs

Given an array of integers `popularity_scores` representing the popularity scores of songs in a music festival playlist, return the number of popular song pairs.

A pair `(i, j)` is called popular if the songs have the same popularity score and `i < j`.

**Hint:** number of pairs = (n Ã— n-1)/2

```python
def num_popular_pairs(popularity_scores):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
popularity_scores1 = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3]
popularity_scores2 = [1, 1, 1, 1]
popularity_scores3 = [1, 2, 3]

print(num_popular_pairs(popularity_scores1))
print(num_popular_pairs(popularity_scores2))
print(num_popular_pairs(popularity_scores3))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
4
6
0
```

### Problem 9: Stage Arrangement Difference Between Two Performances

You are given two strings `s` and `t` representing the stage arrangements of performers in two different performances at a music festival, such that every performer occurs at most once in `s` and `t`, and `t` is a permutation of `s`.

The stage arrangement difference between `s` and `t` is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the index of the occurrence of each performer in `s` and the index of the occurrence of the same performer in `t`.

Return the stage arrangement difference between `s` and `t`.

A permutation is a rearrangement of a sequence. For example, [3, 1, 2] and [2, 1, 3] are both permutations of the list [1, 2, 3].

**Hint:** Absolute value function

```python
def find_stage_arrangement_difference(s, t):
    """
    :type s: List[str]
    :type t: List[str]
    :rtype: int
    """
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
s1 = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
t1 = ["Bob", "Alice", "Charlie"]
s2 = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]
t2 = ["Eve", "David", "Bob", "Alice", "Charlie"]

print(find_stage_arrangement_difference(s1, t1))
print(find_stage_arrangement_difference(s2, t2))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
2
12
```

### Problem 10: VIP Passes and Guests

You're given strings `vip_passes` representing the types of guests that have VIP passes, and `guests` representing the guests you have at the music festival. Each character in `guests` is a type of guest you have. You want to know how many of the guests you have are also VIP pass holders.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of guest from "A".

Here is the pseudocode for the problem. Implement this in Python and explain your implementation step-by-step.

1. Create an empty set called `vip_set`.
2. For each character in `vip_passes`, add it to `vip_set`.
3. Initialize a counter variable to 0.
4. For each character in `guests`:
   - If the character is in `vip_set`, increment the count by 1.
5. Return the count.

```python
def num_VIP_guests(vip_passes, guests):
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
vip_passes1 = "aA"
guests1 = "aAAbbbb"

vip_passes2 = "z"
guests2 = "ZZ"

print(num_VIP_guests(vip_passes1, guests1))
print(num_VIP_guests(vip_passes2, guests2))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
3
0
```

### Problem 11: Performer Schedule Pattern

Given a string `pattern` and a string `schedule`, return `True` if `schedule` follows the same pattern. Return `False` otherwise.

Here, "follow" means a full match, such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between a letter in `pattern` and a non-empty word in `schedule`.

You are provided with a partially implemented and buggy version of the solution. Identify and fix the bugs in the code. Then, perform a thorough code review and suggest improvements.

```python
def schedule_pattern(pattern, schedule):
    
    genres = schedule.split()

    if len(genres) == len(pattern):
        return True

    char_to_genre = {}
    genre_to_char = {}

    for char, genre in zip(pattern, genres):
        if char in char_to_genre:
            if char_to_genre[char] == genre:
                return True
        else:
            char_to_genre[char] = genre

        if genre in genre_to_char:
            if genre_to_char[genre] == char:
                return True
        else:
            genre_to_char[genre] = char

    return False
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
pattern1 = "abba"
schedule1 = "rock jazz jazz rock"

pattern2 = "abba"
schedule2 = "rock jazz jazz blues"

pattern3 = "aaaa"
schedule3 = "rock jazz jazz rock"

print(schedule_pattern(pattern1, schedule1))
print(schedule_pattern(pattern2, schedule2))
print(schedule_pattern(pattern3, schedule3))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
True
False
False
```

**âœ¨ AI Hint:** zip()

### Problem 12: Sort the Performers

You are given an array of strings `performer_names`, and an array `performance_times` that consists of distinct positive integers representing the performance durations in minutes. Both arrays are of length n.

For each index i, `performer_names[i]` and `performance_times[i]` denote the name and performance duration of the ith performer.

Return `performer_names` sorted in descending order by the performance durations.

```python
def sort_performers(performer_names, performance_times):
    """
    :type performer_names: List[str]
    :type performance_times: List[int]
    :rtype: List[str]
    """
    pass
```

**Example Usage:**
```python
performer_names1 = ["Mary", "John", "Emma"]
performance_times1 = [180, 165, 170]

performer_names2 = ["Alice", "Bob", "Bob"]
performance_times2 = [155, 185, 150]

print(sort_performers(performer_names1, performance_times1)) 
print(sort_performers(performer_names2, performance_times2))
```

**Example Output:**
```python
["Mary", "Emma", "John"]
["Bob", "Alice", "Bob"]
```

**âœ¨ AI Hint:** sorted()
