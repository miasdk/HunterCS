# Daily Practice - Python Interview Success System

## 🎯 Philosophy: Quality Over Quantity (Python Edition)
**20-30 minutes daily beats 4-hour weekend cramming**

Daily consistent practice builds:
- **Pattern recognition** (most important skill)
- **Pythonic thinking** under pressure
- **Muscle memory** for Python idioms
- **Mental resilience** for interview stress

## 📅 Daily Practice Structure

### Option A: Pattern Mastery (Recommended)
```
┌─ Day 1-7: Hash Table Pattern (dict, set, Counter)
├─ Day 8-14: Tree Traversal Pattern (recursion, deque)
├─ Day 15-21: Array/Two-Pointer Pattern (list operations)
├─ Day 22-28: Dynamic Programming Pattern (memoization)
└─ Day 29+: Graph Algorithm Pattern (defaultdict, BFS)
```

### Option B: Mixed Practice
```
┌─ Monday: Hash Table + Review previous mistakes
├─ Tuesday: Trees + Collections module practice
├─ Wednesday: Arrays + Mock interview (Pythonic style)
├─ Thursday: DP + Template practice
├─ Friday: Graphs + Company prep (Python-specific)
├─ Saturday: Mock interview session
└─ Sunday: Review week + plan next week
```

## ⏱️ Daily Session Format (25 minutes)

### Warm-up (5 minutes)

- Quick Python pattern recognition quiz

### Core Practice (15 minutes)
- **NEW learners**: Solve 1 problem with hints/solutions
- **REVIEWING**: Solve 1 problem from memory 
- **ADVANCED**: Solve 1 new + 1 review problem

### Wrap-up (5 minutes)  
- Update practice log
- Note Python patterns used
- Identify tomorrow's focus

## 📊 Practice Tracking (Python-Focused)

### Week 1 Example: Hash Table Mastery
```
Day 1: ✅ Two Sum (Easy) - 12 min - dict pattern ⭐⭐⭐
Day 2: ✅ Valid Anagram (Easy) - 8 min - Counter magic ⭐⭐
Day 3: ✅ Contains Duplicate (Easy) - 5 min - set lookup ⭐
Day 4: ✅ Two Sum (Easy) - 4 min - FROM MEMORY ⭐⭐⭐
Day 5: ✅ Group Anagrams (Med) - 15 min - defaultdict ⭐⭐
Day 6: ✅ Top K Frequent (Med) - 18 min - Counter + heapq ⭐⭐
Day 7: 📝 REVIEW: Solve all 5 problems under 30 min total
```

### Progress Indicators
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Critical** - Must solve from memory using Python idioms
- ⭐⭐ **Important** - Should solve confidently with clean Python  
- ⭐ **Good to know** - Solve with some help

## 🔄 The Anti-Overwhelm Method (Python Edition)

### Rule 1: One Pattern at a Time
- Week 1: ONLY hash tables (dict, set, Counter)
- Week 2: ONLY trees (recursion, deque, classes)
- Week 3: ONLY arrays (list operations, slicing)
- **Never** jump between patterns randomly

### Rule 2: Master Before Moving
- Can solve 3-5 core problems from memory?
- Understand the underlying Python pattern?
- Can explain solution using Pythonic idioms?
- **Only then** → move to next pattern

### Rule 3: Daily Consistency Beats Weekend Heroics
- 25 minutes daily = 175 minutes/week
- Better than 3-hour weekend session
- Builds Python interview stamina and confidence

## 🎯 Problem Selection Strategy (Python-Optimized)

### Phase 1: Pattern Building (Weeks 1-3)
Focus on **Python-pure** problems:
- Two Sum, Valid Anagram, Contains Duplicate (dict/set mastery)
- Maximum Depth, Same Tree, Level Order (recursion/deque)
- Remove Duplicates, Valid Palindrome, Container Water (list ops)

### Phase 2: Pattern Mixing (Weeks 4-6)
Combine patterns with Python features:
- Tree + Hash: Path Sum with Counter
- Array + Collections: Sliding window with deque
- Graph + Dict: Course scheduling with defaultdict

### Phase 3: Company Prep (Weeks 7+)
Focus on **Python-specific** advantages:
- Google: Clean code, algorithm optimization

### Quick Python Pattern Check
Before solving ANY problem, ask:
1. "What Python pattern does this look like?"
2. "Which collections module can help?"
3. "What's the most Pythonic approach?"
4. "How can I make this code cleaner?"

### Red Flags (Stop and Review)
- Taking >20 minutes on "Easy" problems
- Not using appropriate Python collections
- Writing C-style loops instead of Pythonic iterations
- Forgetting type hints and docstrings

## 📚 Resources for Daily Practice

### Within This Repository
- `../Patterns/` - Python pattern-specific guides
- `../../Code-Library/Templates/` - Python templates
- `../../Quick-Reference/` - Python cheat sheets
- `../Python-Stdlib/` - Collections module help

### Python-Specific External (Use Sparingly)

## 🐍 Python-Specific Practice Tips

### Show Python Mastery
```python
# Instead of C-style iteration
for i in range(len(nums)):
    print(nums[i])

# Use Pythonic enumeration
for i, num in enumerate(nums):
    print(num)
```

### Use Type Hints for Professionalism
```python
def two_sum(nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
    """Clean, professional Python with type hints"""
    seen: dict[int, int] = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
    return []
```

### Leverage Collections Module
```python
# Instead of manual frequency counting
freq = {}
for item in items:
    freq[item] = freq.get(item, 0) + 1

# Use Counter for elegance
from collections import Counter
freq = Counter(items)
```

### List Comprehensions for Clean Code
```python
# Instead of manual filtering
result = []
for x in nums:
    if x > 0:
        result.append(x * 2)

# Use list comprehension
result = [x * 2 for x in nums if x > 0]
```

## 🎯 Python Interview Edge Cases

### Handle Python-Specific Issues
- **Integer division**: Use `//` vs `/` appropriately
- **Mutable defaults**: Never use `def func(arr=[]):`
- **Generator vs list**: Know when to use each
- **String immutability**: Understand performance implications

### Show Modern Python Knowledge
- **f-strings**: `f"Value: {x}"` instead of `"Value: {}".format(x)`
- **pathlib**: For file operations instead of os.path
- **dataclasses**: For structured data instead of manual classes
- **typing**: Use type hints throughout

**🎯 Remember**: The goal isn't to solve 100 problems. It's to solve 25 problems so well you could teach them to others using beautiful, Pythonic code!
